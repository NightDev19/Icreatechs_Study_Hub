This Html Structure Helps Me To Understand The basic html and css on how to build a start up website with html i can create the foundation of a website such as paragraphs, image and headers with css i can design the html and change its properties

- now i use **display flex** so it display the html components in center.
- using **flex-direction** so the layout will change into column instead of row.
